        - Example usage:
            - Client sends a GET request to `/conversation`.
            - Server returns the entire conversation from the memory buffer.
            - Client renders the conversation in the chatbox.
    - **Export Chat:**
        - Export chat data:
            - Create a Blob object containing the formatted `exportData`.
            - Create a downloadable link for the Blob.
